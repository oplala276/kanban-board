# Kanban Board Task Management

# Overview
The Kanban project you described is a web-based application aimed at implementing a digital Kanban board for task management. It will provide both front-end and back-end functionalities to facilitate the visualization, organization, and manipulation of tasks.
Features are such as:

Task Card: Each task will be represented as a card on the board, showing the task title and description. This makes it easy to quickly understand what each task entails.Tasks will be stored in MongoDB database.

Add Task: Users can create new tasks by filling out a form with the task title and description. This feature enables easy task creation and entry onto the Kanban board.

Edit Task: The application allows users to modify the title and description of existing tasks. This ensures that task information remains up-to-date and accurate.

Delete Task: Users have the ability to permanently remove tasks from the board. This feature helps in decluttering the board by removing completed or irrelevant tasks.

Task Status: Users can perform drag-and-drop actions to move tasks between different status categories (To Do, Doing, Done). This mimics the real-world experience of moving physical cards on a traditional Kanban board.
